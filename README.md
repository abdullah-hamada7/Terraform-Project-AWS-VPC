# Terraform Project: AWS VPC

## What I did: 

Remote state stored in S3

State locking handled via DynamoDB

Separate variable files for dev and prod environments

Used workspaces for environment isolation

Structured configuration using separate files for variables, outputs, and provider setup

Included a local-exec provisioner for post-deployment actions

Generated a resource graph to visualize the infrastructure


### This setup provides a solid base for expanding into more complex cloud infrastructure while keeping everything modular and easy to manage.
